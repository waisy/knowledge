# Leveraged Tokens (Crypto)

## Overview

Leveraged Tokens (LTs) are ERC20 tokens (or similar standard on other chains) designed to provide holders with leveraged exposure to the price movements of an underlying cryptocurrency, without the complexities of managing margin, liquidation risk, or funding rates associated with traditional futures or perpetual swaps.

Examples include tokens like $BTC3L$ (3x Long Bitcoin) or $ETH3S$ (3x Short Ethereum).

**Goal:** To offer a simple way to gain leveraged exposure via a spot-tradable token.

**Key Characteristics:**
*   **Target Leverage:** A fixed multiple (e.g., 3x Long, -1x Short (Inverse), -3x Short). This leverage is maintained relative to the *underlying asset's price*, not the token's own price.
*   **Underlying Asset:** Usually a specific cryptocurrency perpetual swap contract (e.g., $BTC/USDT$ perpetual).
*   **Rebalancing:** The key mechanism. The fund backing the token automatically adjusts its perpetual swap positions periodically (often daily at a set time, like 00:00 UTC) or when certain thresholds are breached (e.g., if the actual leverage deviates significantly from the target) to restore the target leverage. This prevents liquidation but introduces volatility drag.
*   **No Margin/Liquidation (for the holder):** Unlike directly trading perpetual swaps, the holder of a Leveraged Token does not need to manage margin and cannot be liquidated. However, the token's value can still decline significantly, potentially to near zero.
*   **Example:** Holding \$100 of $BTC3L$ gives exposure similar to holding \$300 worth of BTC perpetual swaps, but without needing to manage margin.
*   **Management Fees:** Issuers typically charge daily management fees, which are deducted from the token's NAV.
*   **Funding Rates:** The costs (or payments) associated with the underlying perpetual swaps (funding rates) are implicitly passed through and affect the token's performance.

## Mechanism: How they work

Behind the scenes, a Leveraged Token represents a basket of perpetual swap positions managed by the token issuer (or a smart contract).

*   **Example: $BTC3L$ (3x Long BTC):**
    *   For every \$1 worth of $BTC3L$ token outstanding, the issuer (or protocol) aims to hold \$3 worth of long BTC perpetual swap positions and borrow \$2 worth of the quote currency (e.g., USD/USDT) to finance it.
    *   The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the token is (Value of Perpetual Positions) - (Value of Borrowed Funds).

**Rebalancing:**
Rebalancing is crucial and is the source of many of the unique characteristics (and risks) of LTs.
*   **Why Rebalance?** Leverage naturally changes as the underlying asset price moves. If BTC goes up 10%, a 3x long position should theoretically go up 30%. However, the underlying perpetual swap position size needs to be adjusted to maintain the 3x leverage target for the *next* period's move.
    *   If the underlying asset price *increases*, the LT needs to *buy more* perpetual contracts to increase its exposure and maintain the target leverage on the now larger capital base.
    *   If the underlying asset price *decreases*, the LT needs to *sell* perpetual contracts to reduce its exposure and avoid exceeding the target leverage on the now smaller capital base.
*   **When Rebalance?**
    *   **Daily:** Most commonly occurs at a specific time each day (e.g., 00:00 UTC).
    *   **Threshold Rebalancing:** May also trigger if the underlying asset moves significantly intra-day (e.g., +/- 10% or if actual leverage deviates too much from the target), forcing an earlier rebalance.

## Volatility Drag (Decay)

This is the most critical concept to understand regarding the risks of holding LTs, especially in volatile or sideways markets.

Because LTs rebalance daily (or more frequently), their performance over periods longer than one day can significantly differ from simply multiplying the underlying asset's performance by the leverage factor. This discrepancy, particularly the underperformance in non-trending markets, is known as volatility drag or decay.

*   **How it happens:** In choppy markets where the price goes up and down, the rebalancing mechanism forces the LT to buy high and sell low relative to the initial position.

**Numerical Example: Volatility Drag in a Choppy Market**

Assume:
*   Underlying Asset (BTC) starts at \$100.
*   Leveraged Token: $BTC3L$ (Target 3x Long Leverage), starts at \$100 NAV.
*   Rebalancing: Daily at end of day.
*   Fees/Funding: Ignored for simplicity.

*   **Day 1:**
    *   BTC Price: \$100 -> \$110 (+10%)
    *   $BTC3L$ Target Gain: +30%
    *   $BTC3L$ NAV (End of Day 1): \$100 * (1 + 3 * 0.10) = \$130
    *   Rebalancing: The fund needs to increase its BTC exposure to maintain 3x leverage on the \$130 NAV. It effectively "buys more BTC" at the \$110 price level.

*   **Day 2:**
    *   BTC Price: \$110 -> \$100 (-9.09%)
    *   $BTC3L$ Target Change (based on Day 2 move): -3 * 9.09% = -27.27%
    *   $BTC3L$ NAV (End of Day 2): \$130 * (1 - 0.2727) ≈ \$94.55
    *   Rebalancing: The fund needs to decrease its BTC exposure. It effectively "sells BTC" at the \$100 price level.

*   **Result after 2 Days:**
    *   BTC Price: Returned to the starting price of \$100 (0% change overall).
    *   $BTC3L$ NAV: Dropped from \$100 to \$94.55 (-5.45% change overall).

**This -5.45% loss, despite the underlying returning to its start price, is the Volatility Drag.**

**Numerical Example: Performance in a Trending Market**

*   **Day 1:**
    *   BTC Price: \$100 -> \$110 (+10%)
    *   $BTC3L$ NAV (End of Day 1): \$130
    *   Rebalancing: Buys more exposure.
*   **Day 2:**
    *   BTC Price: \$110 -> \$120 (+9.09%)
    *   $BTC3L$ Target Gain (Day 2): +3 * 9.09% = +27.27%
    *   $BTC3L$ NAV (End of Day 2): \$130 * (1 + 0.2727) ≈ \$165.45

*   **Result after 2 Days:**
    *   BTC Price: \$100 -> \$120 (+20% change overall).
    *   $BTC3L$ NAV: \$100 -> \$165.45 (+65.45% change overall).

In this trending scenario, the $BTC3L$ performance (+65.45%) is *better* than simply 3 * 20% = 60%. This is due to the compounding effect of leverage in a consistently trending market (rebalancing buys more into a winning trend).

*   **Impact:** Volatility drag significantly erodes the value of LTs over time, particularly in markets that are volatile but lack a clear, persistent trend. The effect is magnified by higher leverage ratios and higher underlying asset volatility.
*   **Consequence:** Leveraged Tokens are generally intended for **short-term trades** targeting strong directional moves, not long-term holding, especially in choppy or range-bound markets.

## Calculation of Token Price / NAV

The Net Asset Value (NAV) or price of the token is calculated based on the performance of the underlying perpetual swap basket between rebalancing periods. The formula provided earlier offers a conceptual approximation:

$$ NAV_{t+1} \approx NAV_t \times [1 + L \times (R_u - F_{avg}) - M] $$

Where:
*   $NAV_t$, $NAV_{t+1}$: Net Asset Value at start ($t$) and end ($t+1$) of the period (typically one day or between rebalances).
*   $L$: Target Leverage (e.g., 3, -1, -3).
*   $R_u$: Return of the underlying asset during the period $(IndexPrice_{t+1} / IndexPrice_t) - 1$.
*   $F_{avg}$: Average Funding Rate paid ($L>0$) or received ($L<0$) by the underlying perpetual swap positions during the period. This is a significant factor often overlooked; high positive funding rates will decay long LTs, while high negative rates decay short LTs.
*   $M$: Management Fees charged by the issuer during the period (e.g., daily fee expressed as a fraction).

Mathematical Details: Precise NAV Calculation

**More Precisely:**
The actual NAV calculation involves tracking the notional value of the perpetual swap positions held by the fund that backs the token.

Let $PositionValue_t$ be the notional value of the underlying perps held per unit of LT NAV at time $t$. To achieve leverage $L$, $PositionValue_t = L \cdot NAV_t$.
The change in NAV comes from:
1.  PnL on the perpetual positions: $PositionValue_t \cdot R_u$
2.  Funding payments: $- PositionValue_t \cdot F_{avg}$ (Sign depends on $L$ and $F$)
3.  Management fees: $- NAV_t \cdot M$

$$ NAV_{t+1} = NAV_t + (PositionValue_t \times R_u) - (PositionValue_t \times F_{avg}) - (NAV_t \times M) $$
Substituting $PositionValue_t = L \cdot NAV_t$:
$$ NAV_{t+1} = NAV_t + (L \times NAV_t \times R_u) - (L \times NAV_t \times F_{avg}) - (NAV_t \times M) $$
$$ NAV_{t+1} = NAV_t \times [1 + L \times R_u - L \times F_{avg} - M] $$
$$ NAV_{t+1} = NAV_t \times [1 + L(R_u - F_{avg}) - M] $$

This confirms the earlier approximation but highlights that $F_{avg}$ (funding) and $M$ (fees) are direct deductions from the return, contributing further to decay beyond just volatility drag.

## Risks and Use Cases

**Risks:**
*   **Volatility Drag:** The primary risk, eroding value over time in non-trending markets.
*   **Rebalancing Risk:** Rebalancing events themselves can cause slippage, impacting performance.
*   **Counterparty Risk:** If issued by a centralized entity, there is risk associated with the issuer.
*   **Liquidity Risk:** Some LTs may have low liquidity, leading to large bid-ask spreads.
*   **Extreme Devaluation:** While direct liquidation like futures isn't faced by the holder, the token value can rapidly approach zero in adverse market moves, especially with threshold rebalancing.
*   **Complexity Misunderstanding:** Users may not fully grasp the impact of daily rebalancing and volatility drag.

**Use Cases:**
*   **Short-term Directional Bets:** Capitalizing on expected strong, short-term price movements.
*   **Simplified Leverage Access:** Gaining leveraged exposure without managing futures positions directly.
*   **Hedging (Short LTs):** Using inverse LTs (e.g., $BTC1S$, $BTC3S$) for short-term hedges, though volatility drag is still a factor.

**Conclusion:** Leveraged Tokens offer a convenient way to access leverage but come with significant risks, primarily volatility drag, making them suitable mainly for experienced traders undertaking short-term strategies.
