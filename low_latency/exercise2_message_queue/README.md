# Exercise 2: Low-Latency Message Queue

## Introduction

In this exercise, you will implement a high-performance, lock-free message queue designed for financial applications where microsecond-level latency is critical. This queue will serve as the backbone for inter-thread communication in a trading system.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and implement lock-free programming techniques
- Apply mechanical sympathy principles for optimal hardware usage
- Create a bounded queue with minimal latency characteristics
- Implement zero-allocation message passing
- Measure and optimize for consistent performance

## Background

Message queues are essential components in high-performance systems, allowing components to communicate asynchronously without blocking. In financial systems, these queues must:

- Provide predictable, low latency even under high load
- Never block producer or consumer threads
- Minimize garbage collection pressure
- Support high throughput (millions of messages per second)
- Maintain correctness under concurrent access

## Requirements

Your implementation should:
1. Support single-producer/single-consumer (SPSC) operation with lock-free behavior
2. Process messages with less than 100 nanoseconds of latency (99.9th percentile)
3. Support throughput of at least 10 million messages per second
4. Avoid all object allocation during normal operation
5. Provide clean handling of queue full/empty conditions
6. Include comprehensive performance benchmarks

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up the Project Structure

```java
src/main/java/com/lowlatency/queue/
├── model/
│   ├── Message.java
│   └── MessageType.java
├── queue/
│   ├── LowLatencyQueue.java
│   ├── RingBufferQueue.java
│   └── QueueConsumer.java
├── benchmark/
│   └── QueueBenchmark.java
├── util/
│   └── UnsafeMemoryAccess.java
└── Main.java
```

### 2. Create the Message Interface

```java
public interface Message {
    int getType();
    long getSequence();
    void reset();
    // Add other message-specific methods
}
```

### 3. Implement a Ring Buffer Queue

A ring buffer (circular buffer) is ideal for this use case:

```java
public class RingBufferQueue {
    private final Message[] buffer;
    private final int capacity;
    private final int mask;
    
    // Using volatile for sequence counters
    private volatile long producerSequence = 0;
    private volatile long consumerSequence = 0;
    
    public RingBufferQueue(int capacityPowerOfTwo) {
        this.capacity = 1 << capacityPowerOfTwo;
        this.mask = capacity - 1;
        this.buffer = new Message[capacity];
        
        // Pre-allocate message objects
        for (int i = 0; i < capacity; i++) {
            buffer[i] = new MessageImpl();
        }
    }
    
    public boolean offer(MessageConsumer consumer) {
        final long sequence = producerSequence;
        final long nextSequence = sequence + 1;
        final long wrapPoint = nextSequence - capacity;
        
        if (wrapPoint > consumerSequence) {
            return false; // Queue is full
        }
        
        // Get the slot in the ring buffer
        final int index = (int)(sequence & mask);
        Message message = buffer[index];
        
        // Let the consumer populate the message
        consumer.accept(message);
        
        // Publish the sequence
        producerSequence = nextSequence;
        
        return true;
    }
    
    public boolean poll(MessageConsumer consumer) {
        final long sequence = consumerSequence;
        
        if (sequence >= producerSequence) {
            return false; // Queue is empty
        }
        
        // Get the slot in the ring buffer
        final int index = (int)(sequence & mask);
        Message message = buffer[index];
        
        // Let the consumer process the message
        consumer.accept(message);
        
        // Update the sequence
        consumerSequence = sequence + 1;
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

### 4. Optimize Memory Access Patterns

For maximum performance, use memory barriers and cache-line padding:

```java
public class PaddedLong {
    public long value = 0;
    
    // Padding to avoid false sharing (assuming 64-byte cache line)
    private long p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7 = 0;
}

public class OptimizedRingBuffer {
    // Cache line padded sequence counters
    private final PaddedLong producerSequence = new PaddedLong();
    private final PaddedLong consumerSequence = new PaddedLong();
    
    // Implementation details
}
```

### 5. Use Memory Barriers

Implement proper memory barriers to ensure visibility across threads:

```java
public boolean offer(MessageConsumer consumer) {
    // Implementation with memory barriers
    
    // Ensure previous stores are visible before updating sequence
    UnsafeMemoryAccess.fullFence();
    producerSequence.value = nextSequence;
    
    return true;
}
```

### 6. Benchmark Your Implementation

Create extensive benchmarks to validate performance:

```java
public class QueueBenchmark {
    private final RingBufferQueue queue;
    private final int iterations;
    
    public void runLatencyTest() {
        // Measure end-to-end latency for messages
        // Calculate percentiles (50th, 99th, 99.9th, 99.99th)
    }
    
    public void runThroughputTest() {
        // Measure maximum sustained message rate
    }
}
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Batching

Improve throughput by processing messages in batches:

```java
public int pollBatch(MessageConsumer consumer, int maxBatchSize) {
    // Poll multiple messages in a single call
}
```

### 2. Busy Spinning

For ultra-low latency, implement busy spinning instead of blocking:

```java
public void spinWaitForNextMessage(MessageConsumer consumer) {
    long sequence;
    do {
        // Add CPU hint for more efficient spinning
        Thread.onSpinWait();
        sequence = consumerSequence.value;
    } while (sequence >= producerSequence.value);
    
    // Process message
}
```

### 3. Direct Memory Access

For large messages, consider using off-heap memory with Unsafe or ByteBuffer:

```java
public class DirectMemoryQueue {
    private final ByteBuffer buffer;
    
    public DirectMemoryQueue(int capacityBytes) {
        this.buffer = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(capacityBytes);
    }
    
    // Implementation details
}
```

## Challenges

1. **Multi-Producer**: Extend your queue to support multiple producers (MPSC queue)
2. **Multi-Consumer**: Implement a multi-consumer queue (SPMC or MPMC)
3. **Variable Size Messages**: Support messages of different sizes efficiently
4. **Backpressure**: Implement a producer-backpressure mechanism
5. **Persistence**: Add a journal to persist messages for recovery

## Testing and Verification

Verify your implementation with these tests:
1. Correctness under high load
2. Performance consistency over time
3. Behavior when queue is full/empty
4. Memory access patterns and cache behavior
5. Latency distribution measurements
6. Thread safety validation
