# Low Latency Programming in Java: Lab Exercises & Techniques

## Lab Exercises for Low Latency Programming

Below is a curated list of lab exercises/projects designed to help you study and practice low-latency programming in Java. These exercises focus on key principles of low-latency systems, such as minimizing garbage collection, optimizing data structures, reducing contention, and leveraging concurrency effectively.

### Exercise 1: High-Performance Order Book Simulator

**Objective**: Build a low-latency order book for a financial exchange that processes buy/sell orders with minimal latency.

**Description**:
An order book is a data structure used in financial markets to match buy and sell orders. This exercise simulates a simplified order book that processes incoming orders and matches them in real-time.

**Tasks**:
- Implement a data structure to store bid (buy) and ask (sell) orders, sorted by price (e.g., using a TreeMap or custom sorted array).
- Write a method to add an order (addOrder(Order order)) and match it against existing orders.
- Minimize object allocation by reusing objects (e.g., use a pool for Order objects).
- Use Lock or LockFree mechanisms (e.g., ConcurrentSkipListMap) to handle concurrent order submissions.
- Measure latency for order processing using System.nanoTime().

**Key Low-Latency Techniques**:
- Avoid synchronized blocks; use java.util.concurrent utilities like ConcurrentHashMap or ConcurrentSkipListMap.
- Minimize garbage collection by reusing objects (e.g., object pooling with ThreadLocal).
- Use primitive types (long, double) instead of wrapper classes (Long, Double).

**Sample Code Skeleton**:
```java
public class OrderBook {
    private final ConcurrentSkipListMap<Double, List<Order>> bids = new ConcurrentSkipListMap<>(Comparator.reverseOrder());
    private final ConcurrentSkipListMap<Double, List<Order>> asks = new ConcurrentSkipListMap<>();

    public void addOrder(Order order) {
        long startTime = System.nanoTime();
        // Add order and match logic
        long latency = System.nanoTime() - startTime;
        System.out.println("Order processed in " + latency + " ns");
    }

    static class Order {
        long id;
        double price;
        int quantity;
        boolean isBuy;
        // Constructor and pooling logic
    }
}
```

**Challenge**:
- Optimize to handle 1 million orders/second with latency < 1 microsecond.
- Use Agrona or Chronicle libraries for high-performance data structures (optional).

### Exercise 2: Low-Latency Message Queue

**Objective**: Implement a lock-free, in-memory message queue for high-throughput, low-latency message passing.

**Description**:
A message queue is a critical component in low-latency systems (e.g., trading platforms, event-driven systems). This exercise builds a single-producer, single-consumer (SPSC) queue optimized for minimal latency.

**Tasks**:
- Implement a ring buffer-based queue (fixed capacity, e.g., 1024 messages).
- Use volatile variables and AtomicLong for thread-safe producer/consumer operations without locks.
- Minimize allocations by pre-allocating message objects or using direct memory (ByteBuffer).
- Benchmark throughput and latency under load (e.g., 10 million messages).
- Add a simple producer and consumer thread to test the queue.

**Key Low-Latency Techniques**:
- Use sun.misc.Unsafe or VarHandle for low-level memory operations (optional).
- Avoid locks; rely on CAS (Compare-And-Swap) operations.
- Use Unsafe or ByteBuffer for off-heap storage to reduce GC pressure.

**Sample Code Skeleton**:
```java
public class SPSCQueue<T> {
    private final T[] buffer;
    private final int capacity;
    private volatile long head = 0;
    private volatile long tail = 0;

    public SPSCQueue(int capacity) {
        this.capacity = capacity;
        this.buffer = (T[]) new Object[capacity];
    }

    public boolean offer(T item) {
        long nextTail = tail + 1;
        if (nextTail - head > capacity) return false;
        buffer[(int) (tail % capacity)] = item;
        tail = nextTail;
        return true;
    }

    public T poll() {
        if (head == tail) return null;
        T item = buffer[(int) (head % capacity)];
        head++;
        return item;
    }
}
```

**Challenge**:
- Extend to a multi-producer, multi-consumer (MPMC) queue using Disruptor library.
- Achieve < 100 ns latency for message passing.

### Exercise 3: Latency-Sensitive Metrics Aggregator

**Objective**: Build a low-latency system to collect and aggregate metrics (e.g., latency, throughput) in real-time.

**Description**:
Low-latency systems often need to monitor their performance without introducing overhead. This exercise builds a metrics aggregator that collects and summarizes data (e.g., average latency, percentiles) with minimal impact on the main application.

**Tasks**:
- Implement a thread-safe metrics collector that records latency measurements.
- Use a HdrHistogram (from org.HdrHistogram) for high-precision latency tracking.
- Minimize contention by using thread-local storage for initial data collection.
- Periodically aggregate metrics (e.g., every 1 second) and output percentiles (50th, 99th, 99.9th).
- Simulate a workload (e.g., random delays) to generate metrics.

**Key Low-Latency Techniques**:
- Use ThreadLocal to avoid contention during metric collection.
- Avoid allocations in the hot path; pre-allocate histograms.
- Use VarHandle or AtomicReference for thread-safe updates.

**Sample Code Skeleton**:
```java
import org.HdrHistogram.Histogram;

public class MetricsAggregator {
    private final ThreadLocal<Histogram> threadLocalHistogram = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> new Histogram(3));
    private final Histogram globalHistogram = new Histogram(3);

    public void recordLatency(long nanos) {
        threadLocalHistogram.get().recordValue(nanos);
    }

    public void aggregateAndReport() {
        globalHistogram.reset();
        threadLocalHistogram.get().add(threadLocalHistogram.get());
        System.out.println("99th percentile: " + globalHistogram.getValueAtPercentile(99.0) + " ns");
    }
}
```

**Challenge**:
- Optimize to handle 100 million measurements/second.
- Integrate with JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness) to validate performance.

### Exercise 4: Low-Latency Trading Signal Processor

**Objective**: Build a system to process real-time market data and generate trading signals with minimal latency.

**Description**:
This project simulates a trading system that processes incoming market ticks (price updates) and generates buy/sell signals based on a simple moving average crossover strategy.

**Tasks**:
- Implement a Tick class to represent market data (e.g., price, timestamp).
- Build a SignalProcessor that maintains a sliding window of prices and computes two moving averages (e.g., 10-tick and 50-tick).
- Generate a signal (buy/sell) when the short-term average crosses the long-term average.
- Use a lock-free data structure (e.g., Agrona's RingBuffer) to handle incoming ticks.
- Measure end-to-end latency from tick receipt to signal generation.

**Key Low-Latency Techniques**:
- Use fixed-size arrays for sliding windows to avoid dynamic resizing.
- Minimize allocations by reusing Tick objects.
- Use Disruptor or Agrona for high-performance event processing.

**Sample Code Skeleton**:
```java
public class SignalProcessor {
    private final double[] shortWindow = new double[10];
    private final double[] longWindow = new double[50];
    private int shortIndex = 0, longIndex = 0;

    public void processTick(Tick tick) {
        long startTime = System.nanoTime();
        shortWindow[shortIndex % 10] = tick.price;
        longWindow[longIndex % 50] = tick.price;
        shortIndex++;
        longIndex++;
        if (shortIndex >= 10 && longIndex >= 50) {
            double shortAvg = computeAverage(shortWindow);
            double longAvg = computeAverage(longWindow);
            if (shortAvg > longAvg) {
                System.out.println("Buy signal");
            } else if (shortAvg < longAvg) {
                System.out.println("Sell signal");
            }
        }
        long latency = System.nanoTime() - startTime;
        System.out.println("Signal processed in " + latency + " ns");
    }

    private double computeAverage(double[] window) {
        double sum = 0;
        for (double v : window) sum += v;
        return sum / window.length;
    }

    static class Tick {
        double price;
        long timestamp;
    }
}
```

**Challenge**:
- Optimize to process 10 million ticks/second with < 500 ns latency.
- Add support for multiple strategies running concurrently.

### Exercise 5: Custom Memory Allocator for Low-Latency Applications

**Objective**: Build a custom memory allocator to reduce GC overhead in a low-latency system.

**Description**:
Garbage collection is a major source of latency spikes. This exercise builds a simple slab allocator that pre-allocates memory chunks and reuses them to avoid GC.

**Tasks**:
- Implement a SlabAllocator that allocates fixed-size memory blocks (e.g., 64 bytes).
- Use ByteBuffer or Unsafe for off-heap memory management.
- Provide allocate() and free() methods to manage memory.
- Integrate the allocator into a simple application (e.g., storing Order objects from Exercise 1).
- Measure GC pauses using -XX:+PrintGCDetails to validate the allocator's effectiveness.

**Key Low-Latency Techniques**:
- Use off-heap memory to bypass GC entirely.
- Pre-allocate memory to avoid runtime allocation overhead.
- Use Unsafe for direct memory access (advanced).

**Sample Code Skeleton**:
```java
import sun.misc.Unsafe;
import java.lang.reflect.Field;

public class SlabAllocator {
    private static final Unsafe UNSAFE = getUnsafe();
    private final long baseAddress;
    private final int blockSize = 64;
    private final int numBlocks;
    private final boolean[] freeList;

    public SlabAllocator(int numBlocks) {
        this.numBlocks = numBlocks;
        this.freeList = new boolean[numBlocks];
        this.baseAddress = UNSAFE.allocateMemory(numBlocks * blockSize);
    }

    public long allocate() {
        for (int i = 0; i < numBlocks; i++) {
            if (!freeList[i]) {
                freeList[i] = true;
                return baseAddress + i * blockSize;
            }
        }
        throw new IllegalStateException("No free blocks");
    }

    public void free(long address) {
        int index = (int) ((address - baseAddress) / blockSize);
        freeList[index] = false;
    }

    private static Unsafe getUnsafe() {
        try {
            Field f = Unsafe.class.getDeclaredField("theUnsafe");
            f.setAccessible(true);
            return (Unsafe) f.get(null);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Cannot access Unsafe", e);
        }
    }
}
```

**Challenge**:
- Support variable-size allocations.
- Integrate with a real application (e.g., Exercise 1's OrderBook).

## Advanced Memory Management Techniques for Low-Latency Java

Memory management is critical for low-latency Java applications, as garbage collection (GC) pauses, excessive allocations, and inefficient memory usage can introduce unpredictable latency spikes. These techniques focus on minimizing GC overhead, optimizing memory allocation, and leveraging off-heap memory.

### 1. Object Pooling

**Description**: Reuse objects instead of creating and discarding them to reduce GC pressure and allocation overhead.

**Why It Helps**:
- Frequent object creation triggers GC, causing pauses.
- Pooling pre-allocates objects and reuses them, minimizing allocations in the hot path.

**Implementation**:
- Use a pool to manage reusable objects (e.g., Apache Commons Pool or a custom implementation).
- Store objects in a ConcurrentLinkedQueue or ArrayDeque for thread-safe or single-threaded access.
- Ensure objects are reset before reuse to avoid data leakage.

**Example**:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue;
import java.util.function.Supplier;

public class ObjectPool<T> {
    private final ConcurrentLinkedQueue<T> pool = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>();
    private final Supplier<T> factory;

    public ObjectPool(Supplier<T> factory, int initialSize) {
        this.factory = factory;
        for (int i = 0; i < initialSize; i++) {
            pool.offer(factory.get());
        }
    }

    public T borrow() {
        T obj = pool.poll();
        return obj != null ? obj : factory.get();
    }

    public void returnObject(T obj) {
        pool.offer(obj);
    }
}

// Usage
ObjectPool<Order> orderPool = new ObjectPool<>(Order::new, 1000);
Order order = orderPool.borrow();
// Use order
orderPool.returnObject(order);
```

**Use Cases**:
- Reusing event objects in a high-throughput system (e.g., trading orders, messages).
- Managing temporary buffers in I/O-heavy applications.

**Caveats**:
- Pools can increase memory footprint if not sized correctly.
- Requires careful object cleanup to prevent state leakage.

### 2. Off-Heap Memory (Direct Memory)

**Description**: Store data outside the Java heap using ByteBuffer or sun.misc.Unsafe to bypass GC entirely.

**Why It Helps**:
- Off-heap memory is not managed by the GC, eliminating GC pauses for large datasets.
- Ideal for storing large, long-lived data structures or buffers.

**Implementation**:
- Use ByteBuffer.allocateDirect() for off-heap memory.
- Alternatively, use sun.misc.Unsafe for low-level control (requires reflection or module permissions in Java 9+).
- Manage memory manually, including allocation and deallocation.

**Example**:
```java
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;

public class OffHeapStore {
    private final ByteBuffer buffer;
    private final int capacity;

    public OffHeapStore(int capacity) {
        this.capacity = capacity;
        this.buffer = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(capacity);
    }

    public void putLong(long offset, long value) {
        buffer.putLong((int) offset, value);
    }

    public long getLong(long offset) {
        return buffer.getLong((int) offset);
    }

    public void free() {
        // No explicit free in ByteBuffer; rely on GC to clean up direct memory
    }
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Storing large datasets (e.g., market data, order books).
- High-performance I/O (e.g., network buffers).

**Caveats**:
- Direct memory is limited by -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize (default is heap size).
- Manual memory management risks leaks if not deallocated properly.
- Unsafe is unsupported and may break in future Java versions.

### 3. Slab Allocation

**Description**: Pre-allocate fixed-size memory blocks (slabs) and manage them manually to reduce allocation overhead.

**Why It Helps**:
- Provides predictable allocation latency by avoiding dynamic heap resizing.
- Reduces fragmentation compared to general-purpose allocators.

**Implementation**:
- Allocate a large off-heap or on-heap buffer and divide it into fixed-size slabs.
- Use a free-list or bitmap to track available slabs.
- Integrate with ByteBuffer or Unsafe for memory access.

**Example**:
```java
public class SlabAllocator {
    private final ByteBuffer buffer;
    private final boolean[] freeList;
    private final int blockSize = 64;
    private final int numBlocks;

    public SlabAllocator(int numBlocks) {
        this.numBlocks = numBlocks;
        this.freeList = new boolean[numBlocks];
        this.buffer = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(numBlocks * blockSize);
    }

    public long allocate() {
        for (int i = 0; i < numBlocks; i++) {
            if (!freeList[i]) {
                freeList[i] = true;
                return i * blockSize;
            }
        }
        throw new IllegalStateException("No free blocks");
    }

    public void free(long offset) {
        int index = (int) (offset / blockSize);
        freeList[index] = false;
    }

    public void putLong(long offset, long value) {
        buffer.putLong((int) offset, value);
    }
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Managing fixed-size objects (e.g., orders, messages) in a low-latency system.
- Replacing heap-based allocations in performance-critical paths.

**Caveats**:
- Requires careful sizing to avoid wasting memory.
- Manual management increases complexity.

### 4. Thread-Local Storage

**Description**: Use ThreadLocal to allocate per-thread memory, reducing contention and GC overhead.

**Why It Helps**:
- Avoids synchronization overhead in multi-threaded applications.
- Thread-local objects are reused, reducing allocations.

**Implementation**:
- Use ThreadLocal to store thread-specific buffers, histograms, or pools.
- Combine with object pooling for maximum efficiency.
- Clean up ThreadLocal instances to prevent memory leaks in thread pools.

**Example**:
```java
public class ThreadLocalBuffer {
    private static final ThreadLocal<ByteBuffer> BUFFER = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> ByteBuffer.allocate(1024));

    public ByteBuffer getBuffer() {
        ByteBuffer buffer = BUFFER.get();
        buffer.clear(); // Reset for reuse
        return buffer;
    }
}

// Usage
ThreadLocalBuffer tlBuffer = new ThreadLocalBuffer();
ByteBuffer buffer = tlBuffer.getBuffer();
// Use buffer
```

**Use Cases**:
- Temporary buffers for I/O or serialization.
- Thread-local metrics collection (e.g., latency histograms).

**Caveats**:
- Can leak memory if threads are not properly terminated.
- Increases memory usage with many threads.

### 5. Flyweight Pattern

**Description**: Share immutable or intrinsic data across objects to reduce memory usage.

**Why It Helps**:
- Reduces memory footprint by avoiding duplicate data.
- Minimizes allocations for frequently used objects.

**Implementation**:
- Separate intrinsic (shared) and extrinsic (context-specific) state.
- Use a factory to manage shared flyweight objects.
- Store intrinsic data in a ConcurrentHashMap for thread-safe access.

**Example**:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

public class FlyweightOrder {
    private static final ConcurrentHashMap<String, OrderType> types = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    // Intrinsic state (shared)
    static class OrderType {
        final String type; // e.g., "LIMIT", "MARKET"
        OrderType(String type) { this.type = type; }
    }

    // Extrinsic state (per instance)
    private final OrderType type;
    private final double price;

    private FlyweightOrder(String type, double price) {
        this.type = types.computeIfAbsent(type, OrderType::new);
        this.price = price;
    }

    public static FlyweightOrder create(String type, double price) {
        return new FlyweightOrder(type, price);
    }
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Managing shared metadata (e.g., order types, symbols).
- Reducing memory in systems with many similar objects.

**Caveats**:
- Requires careful design to separate intrinsic/extrinsic state.
- Shared state must be immutable to avoid concurrency issues.

### 6. Primitive Collections and Arrays

**Description**: Use primitive types (int, long, double) and arrays instead of wrapper classes (Integer, Long, Double) or collections (List, Map).

**Why It Helps**:
- Primitives avoid boxing/unboxing overhead and reduce memory usage.
- Arrays have lower overhead than collections and are cache-friendly.

**Implementation**:
- Replace List<Integer> with int[] or libraries like fastutil or Agrona.
- Use fixed-size arrays or custom data structures for predictable performance.
- Pre-allocate arrays to avoid resizing.

**Example**:
```java
import it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.longs.LongArrayList;

public class PrimitiveStore {
    private final LongArrayList values = new LongArrayList();

    public void add(long value) {
        values.add(value);
    }

    public long get(int index) {
        return values.getLong(index);
    }
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Storing large datasets (e.g., prices, timestamps).
- Performance-critical loops where boxing is costly.

**Caveats**:
- Fixed-size arrays require careful sizing.
- Custom collections may lack flexibility.

### 7. Struct-Like Objects with Packed Memory Layout

**Description**: Design objects to minimize memory overhead and improve cache locality.

**Why It Helps**:
- Reduces memory usage by avoiding object headers and padding.
- Improves cache efficiency by aligning data tightly.

**Implementation**:
- Use byte[] or ByteBuffer to store data in a packed format.
- Define a schema for fields (e.g., 8 bytes for long, 4 bytes for int).
- Access fields using offsets with ByteBuffer or Unsafe.

**Example**:
```java
public class PackedOrder {
    private final ByteBuffer buffer;
    private static final int PRICE_OFFSET = 0;
    private static final int QUANTITY_OFFSET = 8;

    public PackedOrder() {
        buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(16); // 8 bytes for price, 8 for quantity
    }

    public void setPrice(double price) {
        buffer.putDouble(PRICE_OFFSET, price);
    }

    public void setQuantity(long quantity) {
        buffer.putLong(QUANTITY_OFFSET, quantity);
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return buffer.getDouble(PRICE_OFFSET);
    }

    public long getQuantity() {
        return buffer.getLong(QUANTITY_OFFSET);
    }
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- High-frequency trading systems with fixed-size records.
- Serialization/deserialization of compact data.

**Caveats**:
- Manual offset management is error-prone.
- Less flexible than traditional objects.

### 8. Memory-Mapped Files

**Description**: Use MappedByteBuffer to map files directly into memory for low-latency I/O.

**Why It Helps**:
- Avoids copying data between kernel and user space.
- Provides off-heap storage with persistence.

**Implementation**:
- Use FileChannel.map() to create a MappedByteBuffer.
- Access data as if it were in memory.
- Ensure proper cleanup to avoid resource leaks.

**Example**:
```java
import java.nio.MappedByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.FileChannel;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption;

public class MemoryMappedStore {
    private final MappedByteBuffer buffer;

    public MemoryMappedStore(String filePath, long size) throws Exception {
        try (FileChannel channel = FileChannel.open(
                Paths.get(filePath),
                StandardOpenOption.READ,
                StandardOpenOption.WRITE,
                StandardOpenOption.CREATE)) {
            buffer = channel.map(FileChannel.MapMode.READ_WRITE, 0, size);
        }
    }

    public void putLong(long offset, long value) {
        buffer.putLong((int) offset, value);
    }

    public long getLong(long offset) {
        return buffer.getLong((int) offset);
    }
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Persisting large datasets (e.g., market data logs).
- Shared memory between processes.

**Caveats**:
- Limited by file system and OS constraints.
- Requires careful synchronization for concurrent access.

### 9. Garbage Collection Tuning

**Description**: Configure the JVM's garbage collector to minimize pauses and optimize memory usage.

**Why It Helps**:
- Reduces frequency and duration of GC pauses.
- Ensures predictable performance in low-latency applications.

**Implementation**:
- Use low-pause GCs like ZGC (-XX:+UseZGC) or Shenandoah (-XX:+UseShenandoahGC).
- Set -Xms and -Xmx to the same value to avoid heap resizing.
- Enable -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch to pre-allocate memory.
- Monitor GC with -XX:+PrintGCDetails and -Xlog:gc*.
- Tune young generation size (-XX:NewRatio) to reduce minor GCs.

**Example JVM Flags**:
```
java -Xms4g -Xmx4g -XX:+UseZGC -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:+PrintGCDetails -jar app.jar
```

**Use Cases**:
- Any low-latency application where GC pauses are a concern.
- Systems with predictable memory usage patterns.

**Caveats**:
- Requires experimentation to find optimal settings.
- ZGC/Shenandoah may increase CPU usage.

### 10. Custom Serialization

**Description**: Implement custom serialization to reduce memory usage and allocation during data transfer.

**Why It Helps**:
- Avoids overhead of Java's default serialization (ObjectOutputStream).
- Produces compact representations, reducing memory and I/O.

**Implementation**:
- Use ByteBuffer or libraries like Kryo or Chronicle for efficient serialization.
- Serialize only necessary fields, using packed formats.
- Avoid creating temporary objects during serialization.

**Example**:
```java
public class OrderSerializer {
    public static void serialize(Order order, ByteBuffer buffer) {
        buffer.putLong(order.id);
        buffer.putDouble(order.price);
        buffer.putInt(order.quantity);
    }

    public static Order deserialize(ByteBuffer buffer) {
        Order order = new Order();
        order.id = buffer.getLong();
        order.price = buffer.getDouble();
        order.quantity = buffer.getInt();
        return order;
    }
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Network communication in distributed systems.
- Persisting data to disk or off-heap storage.

**Caveats**:
- Requires manual schema management.
- Error-prone if not carefully tested.

## Additional Tools and Libraries

- **Agrona**: Provides off-heap buffers, ring buffers, and high-performance collections.
- **Chronicle**: Offers off-heap persistence and low-latency messaging.
- **fastutil**: Primitive collections with lower memory overhead than standard Java collections.
- **HdrHistogram**: Tracks memory usage and latency with minimal overhead.
- **JCTools**: High-performance concurrent data structures (e.g., queues).

### Profile Memory Usage:
- Use VisualVM, YourKit, or JFR to identify allocation hotspots.
- Monitor GC pauses with -XX:+PrintGCDetails or jstat.

### Benchmark Changes:
- Use JMH to measure the impact of memory optimizations.
- Focus on tail latency (99.9th percentile) for low-latency systems.

### Test Under Load:
- Simulate realistic workloads to ensure memory techniques scale.
- Use tools like Apache JMeter or custom load generators.

### Combine Techniques:
- For example, use off-heap memory with slab allocation and thread-local storage for maximum efficiency.

### Monitor and Tune:
- Continuously monitor memory usage and GC behavior in production.
- Adjust JVM flags and pool sizes based on observed patterns.

## Integration with Previous Exercises

These techniques can enhance the lab exercises provided earlier:
- **Exercise 1 (Order Book)**: Use object pooling for Order objects and off-heap storage for the order book.
- **Exercise 2 (Message Queue)**: Implement the queue using off-heap ByteBuffer or slab allocation.
- **Exercise 3 (Metrics Aggregator)**: Use thread-local histograms and packed memory layouts for metrics.
- **Exercise 4 (Signal Processor)**: Store ticks in a memory-mapped file for persistence.
- **Exercise 5 (Memory Allocator)**: Extend with flyweight patterns or custom serialization.
